# How to Create Effective Job Aids

Effective job aids are concise, targeted tools that support task performance at the moment of need. Whether used in training or on the job, their success depends on clarity, accessibility, and alignment with real user workflows.

## 1. Identify the Purpose

Start with a clear objective:
- What task or decision does the job aid support?
- Who will use it and in what context (e.g., high-pressure, daily task, occasional troubleshooting)?

> Focus on **high-frequency or error-prone tasks**.

## 2. Choose the Right Format

Select a format based on the user environment:
- **Checklists** – step-by-step tasks
- **Decision Trees** – troubleshooting or branching paths
- **Flowcharts** – visual sequences
- **Reference Sheets** – definitions, codes, system fields

## 3. Write Clear, Direct Content

- Use **action-oriented language** (e.g., “Click ‘Submit’” instead of “You should click…”)
- Chunk information into short, scannable steps
- Eliminate unnecessary words and background theory

> Keep instructions **under 8 steps** if possible.

## 4. Include Visual Support

Use visuals to reinforce, not distract:
- Icons for tool references
- Screenshots with highlights
- Arrows, numbers, and labels to guide eyes

> Every visual should serve a purpose.

## 5. Design for Accessibility

- Use high-contrast colors and readable fonts
- Ensure compatibility with screen readers (if digital)
- Provide printable formats when needed

> Avoid relying solely on color to convey meaning.

## 6. Test and Iterate

- Conduct quick usability tests with target users
- Ask: Can users complete the task faster or more accurately?
- Revise based on real-world feedback

> Update job aids periodically to reflect system/process changes.

## Bonus: When Not to Use a Job Aid

Job aids work best for **procedural tasks**. They are **not ideal** for:
- Teaching conceptual knowledge
- Replacing full training
- Tasks that change daily

By following these principles, you can create job aids that truly support performance, right when and where it’s needed.

# 📝 Documentation Readability Guidelines

Effective documentation prioritizes readability. Clear sentence structure, visual hierarchy, and scannability allow users to quickly absorb instructions and find what they need. This guide outlines principles and practical techniques for improving the readability of user and installation documentation.

## ✍️ 1. Sentence Structure Tips

- Use **short, simple sentences** (aim for 15–20 words on average)
- Keep one idea per sentence
- Use **active voice** whenever possible:
  - ✅ “Click the install button.”
  - ❌ “The install button should be clicked.”
- Place important information **at the beginning** of the sentence

## 📋 2. Write for Skimming

Most users skim before they read. Help them scan effectively:

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Headings** | Break sections into clearly labeled headers |
| **Bullets & Numbers** | Use lists instead of paragraphs for steps or options |
| **Bold Key Terms** | Highlight buttons, actions, and important phrases |
| **Inline Code Style** | Use backticks for commands or file names: `install.sh`, `README.md` |

## 🔠 3. Visual Hierarchy

Use formatting to guide the reader's eye:

- Use consistent **heading levels**: `#`, `##`, `###`  
- Avoid ALL CAPS; prefer bold or headings instead  
- Align all instructions left for readability  
- Provide **ample white space** between blocks of text  

---

## 🖼️ 4. Support with Visuals

- Add screenshots near complex steps  
- Use **captions** to explain what’s being shown  
- Call out key areas with shapes, labels, or arrows  
- Use icons (✅, ⚠️, ❌) sparingly for alerts and emphasis

## 📏 5. Readability Standards

- Aim for a **grade 8–10 reading level**  
- Use tools like [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/) or [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to assess complexity  
- Avoid jargon or define it in place

# ♿ 508 Compliance Checklist for User and Installation Guides

Section 508 compliance ensures that digital content is accessible to individuals with disabilities. This checklist helps guide the creation of inclusive user and installation guides that align with accessibility standards like WCAG 2.1 and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

## ✅ 1. Document Formatting

- [ ] Use proper **heading structure** (`#`, `##`, `###`) for screen reader navigation
- [ ] Apply consistent and logical heading hierarchy

- [ ] Ensure diagrams have text descriptions or captions nearby

---

## 🎨 3. Color and Contrast

- [ ] Ensure sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for body text)
- [ ] Do **not rely on color alone** to convey meaning
- [ ] Offer visual alternatives such as labels or icons with shapes

---

## 🔗 4. Links and Navigation

- [ ] Use descriptive **link text** (e.g., “Download Installer” not “Click here”)
- [ ] Avoid identical link text pointing to different destinations
- [ ] Include **skip to content** links in web-based HTML guides

---

## 📋 5. Tables and Layouts

## 🧪 7. Testing for Compliance

- [ ] Run guides through accessibility checkers (e.g., WAVE, ANDI, axe DevTools)
- [ ] Manually test with screen reader software (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver)
- [ ] Include accessibility in QA checklists for documentation releases

---

## 🧠 8. Language and Readability

- [ ] Use **plain language** where possible
- [ ] Avoid technical jargon unless defined

## 📝 9. File Format Considerations

| Format | Accessible Practices |

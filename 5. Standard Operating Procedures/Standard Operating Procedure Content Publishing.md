# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Content Publishing

## Purpose
To ensure consistent brand messaging, maintain quality standards, and streamline the content creation and publishing process across all platforms.

## Scope
This SOP applies to all team members involved in content planning, creation, review, publishing, and performance monitoring.

## Responsibilities
- **Content Manager:** Oversees the entire process, approves final content, and ensures alignment with brand strategy.
- **Content Creators:** Develop and submit content according to the established guidelines and schedule.
- **Editors/Reviewers:** Review and edit content for quality, consistency, and compliance with brand standards.
- **Marketing Analysts:** Monitor engagement, collect performance data, and provide insights for continuous improvement.

## Procedure

### 1. Define Content Strategy and Target Audience
- Identify core themes, messaging pillars, and goals for the content.
- Define and document the target audience demographics, preferences, and needs.
- Establish brand voice, tone, and style guidelines.
- Update the content strategy document quarterly or as needed.

### 2. Develop Content Calendar and Schedule
- Create a rolling 3â€“6 month content calendar outlining:
  - Topics
  - Content types (blog posts, videos, social media posts, etc.)
  - Responsible parties
  - Deadlines for drafts, reviews, and publication
- Review and update the calendar monthly to incorporate new priorities or trends.
- Share the calendar with all stakeholders for visibility and collaboration.

### 3. Create and Review Content
- Draft content following the brand guidelines and targeted messaging.
- Submit drafts to the editor/reviewer team by the assigned deadlines.
- Reviewers perform:
  - Quality checks (grammar, spelling, structure)
  - Consistency checks (voice, tone, format)
  - Compliance checks (legal, accessibility, SEO)
- Content is returned to the creator for revisions if needed.
- Final approval is required from the Content Manager before publication.

### 4. Publish Content on Designated Platforms
- Prepare content for each platform (website, blog, social media, newsletter, etc.), ensuring formatting and media requirements are met.
- Publish according to the scheduled time and date from the content calendar.
- Tag, categorize, and optimize posts (e.g., meta descriptions, keywords, alt text for images).
- Verify live posts for formatting accuracy and functionality.

### 5. Monitor Engagement and Analyze Performance
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
  - Views, clicks, shares, likes, comments
  - Time on page
  - Conversion rates
- Use analytics tools (Google Analytics, social media insights, etc.) to collect and review data.
- Generate a performance report monthly summarizing findings and trends.
- Provide recommendations for content adjustments or improvements based on performance data.

## Quality Control
- Regular audits of published content (at least quarterly) to ensure compliance with brand standards.
- Continuous improvement loop: feedback from analytics reports should be integrated into future content planning and creation processes.

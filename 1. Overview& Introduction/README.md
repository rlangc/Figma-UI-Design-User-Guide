- Instructional technologies and LMS integrations
- Troubleshooting frameworks and formatting strategy comparisons (e.g., Markdown vs HTML vs Word)

Each guide may cover:
- Installation & configuration
- User onboarding workflows
- Advanced customization
- Maintenance & removal
- Troubleshooting and recovery steps
- Format-specific authoring strategies

## Intended Users

This documentation is designed for:

- **Instructional Designers** developing software-based training and documentation

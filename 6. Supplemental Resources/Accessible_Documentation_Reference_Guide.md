# ♿ Accessible Documentation Reference Guide

Accessibility ensures that your documentation can be understood and used by people of all abilities. This guide outlines best practices for making documents 508-compliant and usable by those with visual, cognitive, auditory, or motor disabilities.

## ✅ 1. Use Headings Properly

- Use `#`, `##`, and `###` to create clear content hierarchy  
- Avoid formatting text visually to *look* like a heading without using proper syntax  
- Always begin with a single `#` for the main title

---

## 🎨 2. Ensure Color Contrast

| Element | Recommended Ratio |
|---------|-------------------|
| Normal Text | 4.5:1 |
| Large Text (18pt+) | 3:1 |

- Use tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)  
- Avoid using color as the only way to convey meaning (e.g., “click the red button”)

---

## 🖼️ 3. Add Alt Text to Images

- Describe the content and function of images clearly and concisely  
- Decorative images should use empty alt tags (`alt=""`) to be skipped by screen readers  
- Diagrams should include text-based descriptions nearby or in a caption

---

## 🔗 4. Use Descriptive Links

❌ “Click here”  
✅ “Download the accessibility checklist (PDF)”

- Avoid vague links; describe the destination or purpose  
- Avoid duplicating identical links with different URLs

---

## 📑 5. Structure Tables for Screen Readers

- Use simple, grid-style tables  
- Always include table headers (`<th>` or Markdown equivalents)  
- Avoid merged cells or complex nesting

---

## 🛠️ 6. Use Accessible Formats

| Format | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Markdown | Ideal for accessibility when converted to HTML |
| HTML | Full accessibility support with semantic elements |
| Word | Use built-in heading styles, alt text, and Accessibility Checker |
| PDF | Tag documents properly using Acrobat or export from accessible Word files |

---

## 🔊 7. Multimedia Accessibility

- Always provide **captions** for videos  
- Include **transcripts** for audio content  
- Ensure embedded videos do not autoplay or flash rapidly

---

## 🧪 8. Test Your Documentation

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| WAVE | Browser-based contrast and structure test |
| NVDA / JAWS | Screen reader compatibility test |
| Word Accessibility Checker | Built-in checker in Microsoft Word |
| Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools) | Web accessibility and performance audit |

---

## 📌 Summary

Accessible documentation improves usability for everyone—not just those with disabilities. Follow these guidelines to create content that is inclusive, compliant, and effective across a diverse user base.

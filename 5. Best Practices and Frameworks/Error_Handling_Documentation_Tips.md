# ❗ Error Handling Documentation Tips

Clear error handling documentation can significantly reduce user frustration and support tickets. This guide offers best practices for documenting technical errors, resolutions, and preventive steps in user guides and troubleshooting resources.

## ⚙️ 1. Categorize Common Error Types

Organize errors into clear, browsable categories:

- **Installation Errors**: missing prerequisites, corrupted installers  
- **Runtime Errors**: crashes, unexpected behavior, missing files  
- **Network/Connectivity**: firewalls, proxy issues, timeouts  
- **Permissions & Access**: user role issues, read/write failures  
- **API/Integration Failures**: authentication, malformed payloads

## 🧩 2. Use a Consistent Format for Each Error

For every error documented, include the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Error Code or Message** | Exact text shown to the user |
| **Problem Summary** | What caused the error |
| **Steps to Reproduce** | If applicable |
| **Resolution Steps** | Step-by-step fix or workaround |
| **Expected Outcome** | What the user should see after fixing |
| **Escalation Path** | Who to contact if unresolved |

### Example Template

```
**Error:** "Could not connect to server (Error 502)"
**Cause:** Network firewall blocking port 443
**Fix:** 
1. Open firewall settings
2. Allow outbound access on port 443
3. Restart the application
**Outcome:** Application connects successfully
**Contact:** IT Helpdesk – support@example.com
```

## 📋 3. Make It Scannable

- Use **bold** for error messages and key actions  
- Use **tables or bullet lists** for multi-step fixes  
- Avoid long paragraphs; prioritize skimmable layouts

## 🔁 4. Cross-Link Related Errors

- Link similar errors together (e.g., all license activation issues)  
- Include a “See Also” section under each entry for fast navigation  

---

## 🔎 5. Embed Troubleshooting in Context

- Where applicable, include error guidance directly in step-by-step sections  
- Example: after a login step, note common login errors and fixes  

---

## 💡 6. Provide Preventive Guidance

- If the error is avoidable, explain what users can do to **prevent it in the future**  
- “To avoid this error, always save your project before updating…”

---

## 🔄 7. Keep Error Logs Up to Date

- Include log file locations or diagnostic tools  
- Offer example log snippets if users need to submit errors to IT  
- Document how to collect debug information, crash reports, or screenshots

## 📌 Summary

Documenting errors clearly empowers users to self-resolve and improves trust in your platform. Be structured, concise, and proactive in every entry.

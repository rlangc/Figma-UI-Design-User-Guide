# 📘 Installation Guide Best Practices

Creating effective installation guides is essential for ensuring users can confidently set up software, hardware, or systems without unnecessary friction. This document outlines best practices for structuring, writing, and formatting installation guides to maximize usability, clarity, and support.

## 🧱 1. Structure for Clarity

Follow a consistent and predictable structure:

1. **Title and Version** – Clearly state the product and version number
2. **Overview** – Brief explanation of what the user will accomplish
3. **Prerequisites** – System requirements, permissions, software dependencies
4. **Installation Steps** – Ordered, numbered instructions with clear actions
5. **Post-Installation** – Initial configuration, verification, and launch steps
6. **Troubleshooting Tips** – Common errors and quick resolutions
7. **Additional Resources** – Links to documentation, support, or updates

---

## ✍️ 2. Write for the User

- Use **imperative language** (e.g., “Click Install”, “Run the Setup Wizard”)
- Avoid jargon unless defined or linked
- Break complex steps into substeps
- Use plain language and consistent terminology

---

## 🧪 3. Test Everything

- Validate every step on a clean system or VM
- Verify instructions on each supported OS
- Include screenshots or prompts where visual context improves clarity

---

## 🔎 4. Accessibility and Inclusion

- Use descriptive link text (“Download installer” vs. “Click here”)
- Provide alt text for any images or diagrams
- Follow 508/WCAG contrast and heading hierarchy guidelines

---

## 🖼️ 5. Visual and Formatting Guidelines

- Use consistent **heading levels** (`#`, `##`, `###`) for navigation
- Numbered lists for sequential steps, bullets for options or notes
- Apply code formatting for commands, file paths, or filenames (e.g., `setup.exe`)
- Use callout blocks for important notices:

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Disable antivirus before installing  
> ✅ **Tip:** Restart your system after installation

---

## 🔄 6. Keep it Up to Date

- Include a **last updated** date at the top or bottom
- Use semantic versioning if applicable
- Archive or flag outdated guides clearly

---

## 📌 Summary

A strong installation guide supports user success from the first interaction. Write clearly, structure consistently, test thoroughly, and update regularly to maintain trust and usability.

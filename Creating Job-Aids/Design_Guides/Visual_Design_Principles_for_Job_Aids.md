# Visual Design Principles for Job Aids

Design plays a critical role in how effectively users can interact with and apply job aids. Good visual design improves clarity, reduces cognitive load, and enhances usability—especially under pressure or in fast-paced environments.

## 1. Prioritize Clarity Over Style

- Use **simple, legible fonts** (e.g., Arial, Calibri, Helvetica)
- Avoid decorative elements that do not serve a purpose
- Keep the layout clean with generous white space

> The design should serve the content—not overshadow it.

## 2. Use Consistent Layouts

- Keep similar job aids structured the same way
- Use grids or alignment guides to maintain visual balance
- Repeat headers, icons, or formatting for predictable navigation

> Repetition builds recognition and comfort.

## 3. Emphasize What Matters

- Use bold or color blocks to highlight key actions
- Use bullet points, numbering, or indentation for hierarchy
- Place critical information near the top or where the eye naturally lands

> Guide the user’s eye intentionally.

## 4. Apply Visual Grouping

- Group related elements together using proximity and borders
- Use shading or boxes to contain distinct sections
- Avoid visual clutter that competes for attention

> Grouping supports faster scanning and comprehension.

## 5. Use Icons and Imagery Strategically

- Choose icons with familiar, universal meanings
- Pair icons with text labels when possible
- Use screenshots to illustrate UI actions—but crop and annotate them clearly

> Every image should clarify—not confuse.

## 6. Mind the Color Palette

- Stick to 2–3 core colors for simplicity
- Use high contrast for readability (e.g., dark text on light background)
- Be mindful of colorblind-friendly palettes

> Don’t rely on color alone to signal importance or categories.

## 7. Design for Multiple Formats

- Ensure job aids are printable in black and white
- Test readability on both desktop and mobile
- Use scalable layout (single column preferred for print/PDF)

> A good job aid works across formats and devices.

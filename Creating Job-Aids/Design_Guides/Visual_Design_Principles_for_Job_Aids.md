# 🎨 Visual Design Principles for Job Aids

Design plays a critical role in how effectively users can interact with and apply job aids. Good visual design improves clarity, reduces cognitive load, and enhances usability—especially under pressure or in fast-paced environments.

---

## 1. Prioritize Clarity Over Style

- Use **simple, legible fonts** (e.g., Arial, Calibri, Helvetica)
- Avoid decorative elements that do not serve a purpose
- Keep the layout clean with generous white space

🎯 The design should serve the content—not overshadow it.

---

## 2. Use Consistent Layouts

- Keep similar job aids structured the same way
- Use grids or alignment guides to maintain visual balance
- Repeat headers, icons, or formatting for predictable navigation

🔁 Repetition builds recognition and comfort.

---

## 3. Emphasize What Matters

- Use bold or color blocks to highlight key actions
- Use bullet points, numbering, or indentation for hierarchy
- Place critical information near the top or where the eye naturally lands

📌 Guide the user’s eye intentionally.

---

## 4. Apply Visual Grouping

- Group related elements together using proximity and borders
- Use shading or boxes to contain distinct sections
- Avoid visual clutter that competes for attention

🧩 Grouping supports faster scanning and comprehension.

---

## 5. Use Icons and Imagery Strategically

- Choose icons with familiar, universal meanings
- Pair icons with text labels when possible
- Use screenshots to illustrate UI actions—but crop and annotate them clearly

🖼️ Every image should clarify—not confuse.

---

## 6. Mind the Color Palette

- Stick to 2–3 core colors for simplicity
- Use high contrast for readability (e.g., dark text on light background)
- Be mindful of colorblind-friendly palettes

🚦 Don’t rely on color alone to signal importance or categories.

---

## 7. Design for Multiple Formats

- Ensure job aids are printable in black and white
- Test readability on both desktop and mobile
- Use scalable layout (single column preferred for print/PDF)

🖨️ A good job aid works across formats and devices.

By applying these visual design principles, your job aids will not only look better—but work better for the people who depend on them.

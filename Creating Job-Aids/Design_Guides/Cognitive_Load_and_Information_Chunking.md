# Cognitive Load and Information Chunking in Job Aids

Job aids are meant to support performance without overwhelming the user. Understanding cognitive load and using chunking techniques helps ensure that the content is easy to process, remember, and apply.

## 1. What is Cognitive Load?

Cognitive load refers to the mental effort required to learn or use information. Job aids should minimize unnecessary cognitive effort by focusing only on what’s essential.

There are three types of cognitive load:
- **Intrinsic Load** – the complexity of the task itself
- **Extraneous Load** – how the information is presented
- **Germane Load** – the mental effort needed to connect knowledge

Job aids should reduce **extraneous load** to make task execution easier.

## 2. The Power of Chunking

Chunking is the process of organizing information into manageable units:
- Break large tasks into **3–7 step sections**
- Use **headers, borders, or shading** to separate chunks
- Visually group related content using proximity and spacing

Think of each chunk as a single cognitive “package” for the brain.

## 3. Use Familiar Structures

Use patterns the user already knows:
- Lists (bulleted, numbered)
- Tables for comparing options
- Step-by-step workflows
- If-then decision logic

Repetition of structure improves processing speed and memory.

## 4. Prioritize and Sequence

- Present **must-know** information first
- Use hierarchy (bold, font size) to show importance
- Sequence tasks in **logical, procedural order**

The first and last items in a sequence are most memorable (serial position effect).

## 5. Remove Cognitive Clutter

- Avoid jargon or unnecessary background information
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Limit font styles, colors, and dense text blocks

Cognitive noise slows task execution and increases errors.

## 6. Reinforce with Visuals

- Use simple visuals to support comprehension (not decorate)
- Highlight patterns or paths in diagrams
- Avoid overloading visuals with too much text

A well-placed diagram can reduce words and clarify actions.
